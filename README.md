# `lockfree` â€” Lock-free data structures for Multicore OCaml
--------------------------------------------------------

A collection of Concurrent Lockfree Data Structures for OCaml 5. It contains:

* [Chase-Lev Work-Stealing Queue](src/ws_deque.mli)
* [SPSC Queue](src/spsc_queue.mli) Simple single-producer single-consumer fixed-size queue. Thread-safe as long as at most one thread acts as producer and at most one as consumer at any single point in time. 
* [MPSC Queue](src/mpsc_queue.ml)

## Usage

lockfree cam be installed from `opam`: `opam install lockfree`. Sample usage of
`Ws_deque` is illustrated below.

```ocaml
module Ws_deque = Ws_deque.M

let q = Ws_deque.create ()

let () = Ws_deque.push q 100

let () = assert (Ws_deque.pop q = 100)
```
