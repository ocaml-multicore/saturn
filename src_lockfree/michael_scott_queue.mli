    Michael-Scott classic multi-producer multi-consumer queue.

   All functions are lockfree. It is the recommended starting point
   when needing FIFO structure. It is inspired by {{:
   https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf}
   Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent
   Queue Algorithms}.

type 'a t
(** The type of lock-free queue. *)

val create : unit -> 'a t
(** [create ()] returns a new queue, initially empty. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** [is_empty q] returns empty if [q] is empty. *)

val push : 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [push q v] adds the element [v] at the end of the queue [q]. *)

exception Empty
(** Raised when {!pop} or {!peek} is applied to an empty queue. *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a
(** [pop q] removes and returns the first element in queue [q].

    @raise Empty if [q] is empty. *)

val pop_opt : 'a t -> 'a option
(** [pop_opt q] removes and returns the first element in queue [q], or
    returns [None] if the queue is empty. *)

val peek : 'a t -> 'a
(** [peek q] returns the first element in queue [q].

    @raise Empty if [q] is empty. *)

val peek_opt : 'a t -> 'a option
(** [peek_opt q] returns the first element in queue [q], or
    returns [None] if the queue is empty. *)
