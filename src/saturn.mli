(** Parallelism-safe data structures for Multicore OCaml *)

(** {1 Useful Information}

    {2 Domain-Specific Data Structures}
    Some data structures are optimized for specific domain configurations. These
    restrictions enhance performance but must be adhered to for maintaining
    safety properties. These limitations are documented and often reflected in
    the data structure's name. For example, a single-consumer queue should only
    have one domain performing `pop` operations at any time.

    For more details, refer to this
    {{:https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/saturn/blob/main/doc/domain-role.md}
     document}.

    {2 Composability}

    Composability is the ability to combine functions while preserving their
    properties, such as atomic consistency (linearizability) and progress
    guarantees (e.g., lock-freedom). Saturn's data structures, however, are not
    composable.

    For more details, refer to this
    {{:https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/saturn/blob/main/doc/composability.md}
     document}. *)

(** {2 Unsafe Data Structures}

    Some data structures have both a normal and an {b unsafe} version. The
    {b unsafe} version uses `Obj.magic`, which can be unsafe, especially with
    flambda2 optimizations.

    The unsafe version is provided to explore performance optimizations that
    require features not currently available in OCaml, such as arrays of atomics
    or atomic fields in records. These versions give an indication of the
    potential performance improvements when such features become available. It
    is recommended to use the normal version unless the performance requirements
    justify the risks associated with the unsafe version. *)
